List-2 > centered_average

Return the "centered" average of a list of integers, which we'll say is the mean average of
the values, except ignoring the largest and smallest values in the list. If there are
multiple copies of the smallest value, ignore just one copy, and likewise for the largest
value. Use integer division to produce the final average. You may assume that the list is
length 3 or more.


centered_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 100]) → 3
centered_average([1, 1, 5, 5, 10, 8, 7]) → 5
centered_average([-10, -4, -2, -4, -2, 0]) → -3
