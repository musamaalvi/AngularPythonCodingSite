One approach begins with
if is_weekend:
  ...
else:
  ...
In each section, check cigars with >=, <= etc. 
to return True if cigars is in range or else return False. Extra trick:
 for shorter code, note that "return (x >= 50)" automatically returns True if x >= 50 and False if x < 50. 
 This works because the expression "(x >= 50)" evaluates to the value True or False, and then that value is returned.
